# Advent of Code solutions by Me :sunglasses:

In this repo, I will keep trace of all my solutions of the [Advent of Code events](https://adventofcode.com/). \
Some solutions are completely from scratch, some other are inspired from the insanely good solutions of [@norvig](https://github.com/norvig)\
Feel free to judge me for my (bad) code.

## WIP - AoC 2015
Final aim is to complete all years, obviously! Since I wanted to master my C++ lately, I will go for solutions with this language for 2015 event. Let's see how far I can go!
