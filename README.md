# Advent of Code solutions by Me :sunglasses:

In this repo, I will keep trace of all my solutions of the [Advent of Code events](https://adventofcode.com/). \
Some solutions are completely from scratch, some other are inspired from the insanely good solutions of [@norvig](https://github.com/norvig)\
Feel free to judge me for my (bad) code.

## WIP - 2016 refactoring
This event's code is going to be refactored. Final result should be a single Colab Notebook with all solutions (like 2020 file). Until then, solutions will be split between `AoC_2016.ipynb` file and `code` folder
